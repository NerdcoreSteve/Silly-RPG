BUCKET
I should be able to make the player character exactly like npcs, only you control them and the camera should be connected to the player. I need to connect the camera to the player, when the player is walking in the field, then when there is a cut scene, I simply take complete control of the camera
player should have their own current position just like an npc

The editor should allow you to easily direct your own cutscenes.

What about licenses for the images and game-content? Should we do a creative commons attribution?

can we embed cc license info in png metadata?

Only save opposite corners of rects in a file.

Editor should have drag-and-drop

CURRENT GAME
change json to a more sensible format:
and to include all game data, not just player's
actually you should write it all out here before changing the real json
make new json file and gradually adapt to using new json, then get rid of old json file
make sure this file format looks good and makes sense.
each frame has its own collision rect
    what do you do when a change in rect makes an overlap happen? a slow move outward from each
        of the rect's centers.
try to make the python code as general as possible, fit as much as you can into the json, try to make it very customizeable.

split json files, player, field, maybe others?

make two field json's, the game should be able to load both and stitch them together.

document all in wiki, keep updated
    what about code comments? (look up conventions)

game editor, mouse controlled w hotkeys? keep it updated with features of game
    strip json of all un-needed spaces and \n's

make more objects, stuff she can walk behind, and stuff that animates, stuff that she can interact
with, open, break, etc.

can I have a kind of game object that has, not only coll rects, but interact rects? Like a space ship that you can go to the door of, and then and only then the door will open if you hit space or something?

keyboard mappings should be configurable, don't hit things with space, hit them with "activate", shoudl the number of buttons you can use be configurable?

make npcs with programmable actions/animations/paths
    a set of instructions that is basically animated object state changes and movements
    should there be some kind of lookup table that indicates where all npc's are in the game?

transparencies
    "transform":"tranluscent" (see through)
make more images and make more game content with editor
interact with people and objects
    switches and doors and stuff.
    text and drawing primitives for word balloons and other menus
    avatars in dialog boxes, timed printing out of dialog
re-read all ms paint adventures for inspiration
experience rewards: items that gain exp like in ratchet and clank?
adventure game inventory
armor, weapons, items, etc
find items in field, treasure chests, people
money and shopping
Battle engine: final fantasy? chrono trigger? earthbound?
attack, pyshcic powers
cut-scenes like chrono-trigger
in field, reading minds, pyschic influence, telekinesis to move and retrieve things
party follows you like in earthbound
subset of monsters are pokemon pets?
other subset of monsters are possible henchmen?
replay or research kotor for inspiration
replay or research diablo 2 for inspiration
research diablo 3 for inspiration
replay other rpgs you have for inspiration
research other video game and table-top rpgs for more inspiration
plot-story tree
    can I learn and add game ai?
finish game
make a good linux, windows, and mac installer.

SEQUEL I
make isometric platformer a little like chain of memories, but I want good sidescroller action too
dynamically generated content.
keep all features from old game
avatars can vary, like one of the players could be in a mech suit.
vehicles and mounts
vehicle, mount action in field
more skills, abilities, gear.
you see what you wear
    editor allows you to super-impose images
craft all items

SEQUEL II
still 2D
add as many game elements from as many retro games and modern games as you can think of. It should be designed in such a general way that your game can flow from one game genre to another or indeed to mix any amount of them together or create new ones as easily as possible.
