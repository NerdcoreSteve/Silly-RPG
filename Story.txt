Main Character: Aniyah Booker
Like Lina Inverse as a little kid. Cockey. She's the leader of a small group of misfit friends but most people think her and her group are weird.

Aniyah and her friends live in the same neighborhood, which is scooped out of its city and placed among other scoops from other worlds, fantasy, sci fi, whatever you want.

Do a short first episode where Aniyah fights a villan that keeps a marvelous creature (digimon) as a pet, saves the creature, and becomes friends with it. Her other friends are having adventures too but they're not yet playable characters
