TODO

ITERATIONS
*i*
fix
animation delays when arrow keys are pressed

*i*
try to make Animated_Field_Element.set_animation_Frame more DRY

*i*
look over Animated_Field_Element design, does it look good now?

*i*
re-evaluate json structure

*i*
slim down the player input code, possibly use the command pattern or a variation of it

*i*
How does the rest of the code look?

*i*
Work on the design of the player and redraw her frames
She should have an ant head on her shirt instead of a flower. No pinks or purples.

*i*
Design some rooms and corridors of a space ship, one that would be in the player character's pretend fantasies. Make all the tiles and build them in the game.

*i*
license all assets with permissive cc license.

*i*
design and create an editor for this game engine. This will mean more iterations here I'm sure.
from now on all features added to the game will also be added to the editor right after, and assets and other game content will be added to demonstrate it. Make a note above the iterations to remind yourself of this.

*i*
npcs and other animated interactables (the equivalent of treasure chests)

*i*
dialog

*i*
inventory

*i*
doors

*i*
battle engine (action rpg? chrono trigger? hmmm..)

...?

POSSIBLE DESIGN
In this game
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=002153
you sometimes click on stuff and a new picture appears with dialog that goes over it.
neat.
