TODO

try to figure out how to refactor the code
    Field, Field_Element and Player look good
    Animated_Field_Element needs work
    re-evaluate json
    use a variant of the command pattern
    how's it look? 

Do a better job of designing(art) the player, design an area for her to explore, make the tiles and place them.

license all assets with permissive cc license.

lay out some iterations and start on the first one
    start with making an editor

POSSIBLE DESIGN
In this game
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=002153
you sometimes click on stuff and a new picture appears with dialog that goes over it.
neat.
