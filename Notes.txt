*i*
camera
    *i*
    figure out how, exactly, you're going to do this
    *i*
    Then put player in field, player may not even have to be any different from any pc

*i*
consolidate remaining duplicate code between editor and game

*i*
what remaining in-code #TODO's can I get rid of?

*i*
hotkeys, from now on any changes need both mouse and hot keys

*i*
undo-redo

*i*
change z depth
    
*i*
right click move down, move up, send to front/back

*i*
edit collision rect, drag, edit fields, toggle existence, set to image dimensions

*i*
see list of images, and other assets on side, edit them from there too

*i*
browse assets/images folder for images to create new field elements

*i*
edit player

*i*
save changes to sillyRPG.json
    
*i*
maybe take out object methods belonging to game domain and just make them functions

both game and editor should have a game file and saved-game file pickers
    *i*
    create new games

make some more game content, at least a few rooms and hallways in a space ship

*i*
  as well as a new set of animations for player

*i*
consolidate code between game and editor

*i*
save game to json file in folder specified by a config.json file in assets/json (for now just save player position)

*i*
interactibles

*i*
npc's that walk around

*i*
dialog with npc's, just like some of the later mspaint games, not just a little avatar

*i*
but a whole person closeup

*i*
the camera can be another surface, smaller than the field, then the player would be in the field...

*i*
can become another npc/person

*i*
more than one person in your party

*i*
dynamic buffering, perhaps in blocks

*i*
cutscenes! move the camera according to a target, which can be "scripted"

special effects like earth quakes!
