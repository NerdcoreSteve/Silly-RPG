ITERATIONS
*i*
camera
    *i*
    figure out how, exactly, you're going to do this
    *i*
    Then put player in field, player may not even have to be any different from any pc

*i*
consolidate remaining duplicate code between editor and game

*i*
what remaining in-code #TODO's can I get rid of?

*i*
hotkeys, from now on any changes need both mouse and hot keys

*i*
undo-redo

*i*
change z depth
    
*i*
right click move down, move up, send to front/back

*i*
edit collision rect, drag, edit fields, toggle existence, set to image dimensions

*i*
see list of images, and other assets on side, edit them from there too

*i*
browse assets/images folder for images to create new field elements

*i*
edit player

*i*
save changes to sillyRPG.json
    
*i*
maybe take out object methods belonging to game domain and just make them functions

    create new games

*i*
make some more game content, at least a few rooms and hallways in a space ship

*i*
  as well as a new set of animations for player

*i*
consolidate code between game and editor

save game to json file in folder specified by a config.json file in assets/json (for now just save player position)

*i*
interactibles

*i*
npc's that walk around

*i*
dialog with npc's, just like some of the later mspaint games, not just a little avatar

*i*
but a whole person closeup

*i*
the camera can be another surface, smaller than the field, then the player would be in the field...

*i*
can become another npc/person

*i*
more than one person in your party

*i*
dynamic buffering, perhaps in blocks

*i*
cutscenes! move the camera according to a target, which can be "scripted"

*i*
special effects like earth quakes!

DESIGN
class Field
    contains: many Field_Elements

class Field_Element
    description: elements in a field: tiles, npcs, and other interactibles

class Camera
    has reference to: field
    has reference to: field_element
    function: take_picture
            
class Field_Element_Control
    contains: Field_Element
    function: tick

there is a list of field element controls, they control any field element they're attached to.
on one control, tick might look for commands, another might move according to some simple ai, etc
is a camera a field element?
