Work on the design of the player and redraw her frames
She should have an ant head on her shirt instead of a flower. No pinks or purples.

design and create an editor for this game engine. This will mean more iterations here I'm sure.
from now on all features added to the game will also be added to the editor right after, and assets and other game content will be added to demonstrate it. Make a note above the iterations to remind yourself of this.

POSSIBLE DESIGN
In this game

you sometimes click on stuff and a new picture appears with dialog that goes over it.
neat.
---Game Engine---
--States---
Silly RPG will be an RPG with three main states: Wander, Battle, Cutscene, and Limited Animation. The same field is shared between Battle State, Cutscene State, and Wander. Dialog is a feature available in all states.

-Dialog-
Dialog is a word balloon that shows up on the top or bottom half of the screen, position depends on the game-content creator. Text is printed over a timed interval (i.e. there is a delay after each text-character and further delays are possible for dramatic pauses etc). Dialog is available in all states. There is also the option to have animated frames in a box inside and on the left-hand side of the dialog balloon.

-Cutscene State-
In this state the player, npcs, and camera position are under scripted control as well as dialog. The player is still able to choose dialog options.

-Battle State-
Battle State is always preceded and succeeded by Cutscene state. This allows the game content creator to properly position npc's and the player (from here on called combatants) before and after battle. Since there will be no logic to tell combatants to have different animations depending on what position they are in relation to each other, it's recomended that the game content creators choose either to have their battles all occur from left to right (e.g. early final fantasy games) or from top to bottom (e.g. chrono trigger).

The player and npcs will be have the same position on the field they had at the end of cutscene state (it is up to the user of the Game Creation Tool to make sure the screen can show both). The game content creator determines which frames each combatant has at all times.

--STORY SCRIPT--
[note: anything in brackets are used for author commentary]
Synopsis:
The player-character/hero (Aniyah Booker or whatever the player names her) and her neighborhood, is scooped up and transported to an unfamiliar solar system, in which there is an entire field of scooped-up pieces of worlds. [hmmmm... perhaps that's too many?] Creatures/aliens from another world-piece come to attack her neighborhood. The adults tell their children to hide while they go fight the invaders. They are captured and the neighborhood is wrecked. Some children are captured too but our hero and her sister (along with some others she discovers later) are able to hide.

The leader of the invasion (a skeleton looking guy in an outfit that is part motorcycle-ruffian, part evil wizard/knight, and part pirate) takes her parents back to his world. [I had the idea that the parents and others would later be scattered to a bunch of the other worlds, maybe one or two adults and a few kids could be rescued) thus motivating our characters to go out and explore the world-pieces. Perhaps this is the last act of a defeated villain "I have one last bit of magic to use!!" and then he scatters them all.]

Aniyah discovers two creatures fighting over a trinket that they stole from the leader. She finds this out because the two mention it while arguing. Aniyah takes them out and then takes the device for herself, which gives her psychic powers (telepathy, telekinesis, mind-reading, far-seeing, the equivalent to force-persuasion, the whole deal) [should we make in-game consequences to unethical use of mind-reading? hmm...] [eventually all her friends should get special gadgets, have hidden or new powers, get pets, super-ninja training, something.] Aniyah uses her psychic powers to find the other kids. Her sister starts learning about all this alien technology. Another kid starts learning about magic [they'll be our magic user in a later game]. The kids discover stuff about their enemy, fight monsters, etc. We give the impression that the others are tagging along by making them npc's, but for now Aniyah fights alone [because the game engine won't support multiple player characters :) ]

Eventually there is a final battle with the bad guy, who scatters their parents and friends all over the world-pieces. The kids decide to search for them. They also free a "pet" kept captive and abused by the bad guy, whose powers were used by the bad guy without its consent to attack people from other world-pieces, and who has been helping them in subtle ways all along the adventure. The kids take a ship from the lair of the bad guy, his minions now gone (scattered away in fear) and go off on adventures. The End. [at least for this first game.]

We begin the story before her neighborhood has been taken. 

Game Play Screen Play:
Credits fade in one at a time. "Made by [insert name of game dev group here, Rabid Weasels? Robo-Potato?]", "using the Silly RPG game engine" etc. We then cue the title screen. [What's a good title? World Piece?] We then fade to Suburbia, [this is the actual name of the city, the city of Suburbia, maybe the title over the shots of people walking around in the neighborhood, the gas station/convienience-store says "The City of Suburbia" fade out, then fade to "The night it happened".

We move to a cut-scene with Aniyah. We see her using a stick as if it were a sword. [Just to be clear this is now an in-game cutscene, we see the little avatar move around, animated with a little sword. Her dialog is shown in the same dialog window you would see if she were talking with an npc.] She's in an enclosure of trees at a local park, playing pretend. She should be looking after her sister but has lost track of her.

Aniyah: (holding her sword toward an imaginary foe) "I don't know who you think you're messing with Ultra-Saur, but you'd better let go of the prince before I get mad." (She then moves over to the spot where ultra saur was supposed to be and laughs. "Ha Ha Ha, Don't make me laugh Aniyah Star-Basher! you are no match for me and my army of Space-Droids!" She moves to the other side, now the hero again, and says "You asked for it dino-doof, TAKE THIS!" more sword-waving "AND THAT!!---"

suddenly Aniyah's fun is interrupted by "ANIYAH!!! HELP!!!" Aniyah turns in the direction of her sister and then starts running. "Huh? Lil' Sis?" she runs off-screen [perhaps walks fast if I don't want to draw extra animation frames] and then we come to a windy walk-way that goes from left to right. The player as the option to talk with the npc kids that are on the parkway and the one's that are in the grass, on the park merry-go-rount, etc. They're either talking about their own stuff or they are saying they just heard a kid yell, "Isn't that your sister Aniyah?" maybe some of the kids that will later accompany her on her adventures are first seen here.

Finally we come to a spot where two bullys are playing keep-away with Bonnie's computer. [Bonnie is the name of Aniyah's sister.]

Bully1: "Got yer computer nerd! What are ya gonna do about it!" (he's holding the computer above his head. (or maybe the computer is just put in front of the the bully npc and we pretend that it looks like their holding it. :) )

Bully2: [I think maybe showing their names as Bully1 and Bully2 is kinda cool. The kids probably have to rescue them from evil creatures later on?] "Hey we could probably install Space-Nazi's from Mars on that thing!"

Bully1: "I didn't know you'd bought that."

Bully2: "Who said anything about buying it?" [yuk yuk :P ]

Bonnie: "Give it back! Aniyah, help me!"

Battle Scene:



[at some point I would like a suburband street from left to right with the neighbors outside and on the street, maybe after the fight scene.]






NOTES

Main Character: Aniyah Booker
Like Lina Inverse as a little kid. Cockey. She's the leader of a small group of misfit friends but most people think her and her group are weird.

Aniyah and her friends live in the same neighborhood, which is scooped out of its city and placed among other scoops from other worlds, fantasy, sci fi, whatever you want.

Bonnie Booker: Aniyah's little genius sister.


Do a short first episode where Aniyah fights a villan that keeps a marvelous creature (digimon) as a pet, saves the creature, and becomes friends with it. Her other friends are having adventures too but they're not yet playable characters


BUCKET
I should be able to make the player character exactly like npcs, only you control them and the camera should be connected to the player. I need to connect the camera to the player, when the player is walking in the field, then when there is a cut scene, I simply take complete control of the camera
player should have their own current position just like an npc

The editor should allow you to easily direct your own cutscenes.

What about licenses for the images and game-content? Should we do a creative commons attribution?

can we embed cc license info in png metadata?

Only save opposite corners of rects in a file.

Editor should have drag-and-drop

CURRENT GAME
change json to a more sensible format:
and to include all game data, not just player's
actually you should write it all out here before changing the real json
make new json file and gradually adapt to using new json, then get rid of old json file
make sure this file format looks good and makes sense.
each frame has its own collision rect
    what do you do when a change in rect makes an overlap happen? a slow move outward from each
        of the rect's centers.
try to make the python code as general as possible, fit as much as you can into the json, try to make it very customizeable.

split json files, player, field, maybe others?

make two field json's, the game should be able to load both and stitch them together.

document all in wiki, keep updated
    what about code comments? (look up conventions)

game editor, mouse controlled w hotkeys? keep it updated with features of game
    strip json of all un-needed spaces and \n's

make more objects, stuff she can walk behind, and stuff that animates, stuff that she can interact
with, open, break, etc.

can I have a kind of game object that has, not only coll rects, but interact rects? Like a space ship that you can go to the door of, and then and only then the door will open if you hit space or something?

keyboard mappings should be configurable, don't hit things with space, hit them with "activate", shoudl the number of buttons you can use be configurable?

make npcs with programmable actions/animations/paths
    a set of instructions that is basically animated object state changes and movements
    should there be some kind of lookup table that indicates where all npc's are in the game?

transparencies
    "transform":"tranluscent" (see through)
make more images and make more game content with editor
interact with people and objects
    switches and doors and stuff.
    text and drawing primitives for word balloons and other menus
    avatars in dialog boxes, timed printing out of dialog
re-read all ms paint adventures for inspiration
experience rewards: items that gain exp like in ratchet and clank?
adventure game inventory
armor, weapons, items, etc
find items in field, treasure chests, people
money and shopping
Battle engine: final fantasy? chrono trigger? earthbound?
attack, pyshcic powers
cut-scenes like chrono-trigger
in field, reading minds, pyschic influence, telekinesis to move and retrieve things
party follows you like in earthbound
subset of monsters are pokemon pets?
other subset of monsters are possible henchmen?
replay or research kotor for inspiration
replay or research diablo 2 for inspiration
research diablo 3 for inspiration
replay other rpgs you have for inspiration
research other video game and table-top rpgs for more inspiration
plot-story tree
    can I learn and add game ai?
finish game
make a good linux, windows, and mac installer.

SEQUEL I
make isometric platformer a little like chain of memories, but I want good sidescroller action too
dynamically generated content.
keep all features from old game
avatars can vary, like one of the players could be in a mech suit.
vehicles and mounts
vehicle, mount action in field
more skills, abilities, gear.
you see what you wear
    editor allows you to super-impose images
craft all items

SEQUEL II
still 2D
add as many game elements from as many retro games and modern games as you can think of. It should be designed in such a general way that your game can flow from one game genre to another or indeed to mix any amount of them together or create new ones as easily as possible.
TODO
set collision detection

do cc sa-by license for all assets (just like action steve)

evaluate code and see if you can make improvements
    using the command pattern is a good start
    make uml diagram and other documentation
        use stuff on site for documentation and uml, don't just commit it.

set hops for editor and making simple suburban park, do hops
    keep uml and other documentation up to date.

any refactoring or other design improvements?

what do you really need to keep in oldnotes.txt?

CURRENTLY WORKING ON
bug fixing and sundry tasks

ON DEV CYCLE STAGE
Not in a stage yet

DEV CYCLE (change this up as you learn)
decide what feature you're going to add next

make generalized design [big marker on napkin, only a few sentences]

on a high level, decide what [sprints?] will be needed to accomplish this design

get a little more specific designing your next [sprint?]

come up with more granular hops for the first [sprint?]

always have two copies of uml, one for "finished", one for "working-on". Make documentation for first hop and add to working_on.dia for first hop.

do all hops until sprint is done, do all sprints until feature is added

test feature (should really learn how to write/do tests up front)

look for bugs and squash them, do a similar dev cycle for them.

add feature to saving (if necessary) and editor, do similar to above for editor addition

add new game content using new feature

evalute design, do you need to refactor or do any other improvements, do a similar dev cycle for those.

repeat

WHAT'S NEXT?
    editor
    simple suburban park area
    saving (for now just your location)
    interactables
        they animate, move of their own accord, have state,
            you can dialog with them. They are treasure chests
            doors(they can block your way or become non-blocking)
            npcs and all kindsa things
    populate the park with kids and other kinds of interactables
    inventory
        you can use things with other things or use them on interactibles
    make a separate level that has similarities to the park but everything is sci fi and monsters
        some kids play along and others don't so you have monsters saying "I don't wanna play
            your stupid game". But you are collecting stuff, keys, unlocking doors, etc.
            it's all pretend.
    simple battle
        hp, attack, defense, no equipment
        no separate mode like earthbound
        make it realtime?
    add battle to pretend session
    equipment and items
    add another battle to pretend session using these
        you get in-game bonuses for using or getting equipment?
    cutscenes
        What is a cutscene but a bunch of interactibles doing things on cue
    add suburban street, add cutscene with bullies and sister, add battle with bullies
    sliding, animated images cutscenes or "movies"
    intro movie and beginning and ending credits
    make installer, should be very easy for users.
    skills? (hacking, psychic powers, crafting...)
    anything else?
    start writing game script, think about the process of script writing as you do.
    add features and game content showing those features as you see the need for
        new features as you write.
